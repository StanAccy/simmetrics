 * SimMetrics - SimMetrics is a java library of Similarity or Distance
 * Metrics, e.g. Levenshtein Distance, that provide float based similarity
 * measures between String Data. All metrics return consistant measures
 * rather than unbounded similarity scores.

 * Please Feel free to contact me about this library, I would appreciate
 * knowing quickly what you wish to use it for and any criticisms/comments
